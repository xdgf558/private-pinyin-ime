# Platform Smoke Test Plan

Stage 08 defines the manual platform validation record for release-readiness work. Automated CI can compile and test shared code, but Windows TSF activation, macOS InputMethodKit routing, and iOS keyboard behavior must still be verified on real platform hosts.

## Automated Gates

Record the GitHub Actions run URL for each Stage 08 pull request:

| Gate | Required result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Ubuntu Rust workspace | pass | `cargo fmt`, clippy, tests, C demo, scaffold checks |
| Windows Rust workspace | pass | `windows-2022` runs `cargo test --workspace` |
| Windows TSF compile | pass | `windows-2022` builds `PrivatePinyinTsf.dll` with MSVC/CMake |
| macOS AI Helper lifecycle | pass | macOS compiles the controlled-process client and tests authentication, cancellation, crash/restart, and shutdown |
| Windows AI Helper lifecycle | pass | `windows-2022` executes the current-user named-pipe lifecycle probe against the built helper |

## Windows 11 TSF Smoke

Environment:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Tester | |
| Date | |
| Windows version | |
| Architecture | |
| Commit | |
| Build artifact | |

Checklist:

| Check | Expected result | Result | Evidence / notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Build | `scripts/build_windows_tsf.ps1` produces `PrivatePinyinTsf.dll` | | |
| Package | `scripts/package_windows_tsf.ps1` produces zip, EXE setup when NSIS is installed, and MSI when WiX is installed | | |
| Install | EXE per-user install/register succeeds without admin-only HKCU mismatch or 32-bit regsvr32 redirection | | |
| Post-install guide | EXE finish page can open the setup guide, and the guide opens Windows language settings and preferences | | |
| Enable IME | `猫栈拼音` appears in Windows language/input settings | | |
| Notepad composition | Typing `nihao` shows composition and candidate `你好` | | |
| Continuous pinyin | Typing a longer sentence pinyin such as `wojintianxiangquchifan` can produce a multi-word candidate when the segments exist in the lexicon | | |
| Initials shorthand | Typing shorthand initials such as `nh` produces phrase candidates such as `你好` | | |
| Chinese punctuation | Chinese mode commits full-width punctuation such as `，` and `。` | | |
| Commit | `Space` commits `你好` | | |
| Cancel | `Esc` clears composition without leaking keys | | |
| Shortcuts | `Ctrl+C`, `Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+A` pass through while IME is active | | |
| Idle keys | Idle digits, arrows, Backspace, PageUp/PageDown are not swallowed | | |
| Focus cleanup | Start `nihao`, switch to another window, return and type `a`; no stale `nihao` or phantom `nihaoa` composition appears | | |
| Multi-process learning | Use the IME in two apps and select candidates in both; learned selections persist without visible write failures | | |
| AI Lite fallback | On a supported-memory machine, ordinary candidate selection still works when AI initialization is unavailable or deliberately rejected; no key, preedit, candidate, or commit is lost | | Record memory, initialization state, and sanitized error code only |
| AI candidate stability | Type rapidly, backspace, switch candidate pages, and continue composing while AI work is pending; an already visible numbered page never changes identity and stale results never commit | | Repeat in Notepad and one Chromium/Electron app |
| Password-field privacy | In a password field exposing TSF `IS_PASSWORD`, base typing/fallback remains available while no AI result is applied; leaving the field starts a fresh composition with no stale result | | Do not record entered content in evidence |
| AI Helper isolation | Run `scripts/test_windows_ai_helper.ps1`; authentication, health, cancellation, forced termination, restart, and shutdown pass, while Notepad typing remains available with the helper missing or terminated | | Inspect logs only for content-free status/error codes; never enter real private text during fault injection |
| AI Helper idle exit | Leave the authenticated helper unused for ten minutes and confirm it exits; starting a new optional probe creates a fresh authenticated process | | Ordinary TSF typing must remain unaffected before, during, and after exit |
| Settings UI | Privacy, learning, prediction, clear, and export actions run | | |
| Uninstall | Unregister/uninstall removes the input method from the user account | | |

## macOS InputMethodKit Smoke

Environment:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Tester | |
| Date | |
| macOS version | |
| Architecture | |
| Commit | |
| Build artifact | |

Checklist:

| Check | Expected result | Result | Evidence / notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Build | `scripts/build_macos_imk.sh` produces `dist/macos_imk/PrivatePinyin.app` | | |
| Preferences scaling | Preferences opens at the compact default size; dragging a window corner keeps the Station Board aspect ratio from minimum to design size, with no clipping and accurate toggle/button clicks; trackpad pinch does not independently zoom or crop the board | | Verify both 72% minimum and 100% design size, then pinch at the 86% default size |
| Install | `platform/macos_imk/installer/install-local.sh` installs into Input Methods | | |
| Package install | `scripts/package_macos_pkg.sh` pkg installs into `/Library/Input Methods` | | |
| Post-install onboarding | Fresh pkg install launches a new UI-only helper and opens the setup guide with an Open Keyboard Settings button; the helper does not create a second IMK server | | |
| Upgrade process detection | With 猫栈拼音 already active, upgrade install shows `猫栈拼音已更新` and detects only the pre-install same-bundle process | | Keep TextEdit, Safari, Chrome, and VS Code open while testing |
| Immediate post-install activation | Immediately after installation completes, switch away from and back to 猫栈拼音; the newly launched same-bundle PID remains running and is never included in the refresh target set | | Regression for the removed `installedAt + 1s` tolerance; capture PIDs and launch dates before clicking `重新加载猫栈拼音` |
| Consent and app isolation | Before clicking reload, typing continues through the old process; after clicking, no browser, editor, document, or unrelated process closes | | |
| Successful refresh | `重新加载猫栈拼音` completes, switching to another input source and back activates the new version, and the guide says no logout or restart is required | | |
| Refresh fallback | If normal exit is deliberately prevented in a controlled test, guidance asks the tester to save work and logout/login; it does not force-kill, log out, or restart macOS | | Source policy and offline tests must pass even when this path is not induced manually |
| Input source discovery | PrivatePinyin appears exactly once under Chinese/Simplified Chinese input sources after installing the actual `.pkg`; re-open System Settings or logout/login if the list is cached | | TIS keys changed in macOS onboarding work: mode `TISInputSourceID`, top-level `TISInputSourceID`, and `smSimpChinese` must be revalidated. `tsInputModeDefaultStateKey` must remain `false`; setting it to `true` can make third-party modes disappear from the add-input-source selector before the user enables them |
| Input source icon/name | System Settings, the input menu, and the menu bar show the new template icon and Chinese display name `猫栈拼音` in a Simplified Chinese user session | | Revalidate after version bumps, logout/login, or TIS cache cleanup; template icon should adapt to light/dark menu bar states |
| Consecutive upgrade input-source dedupe | After consecutive upgrade installs across two versions, System Settings and the menu bar input menu show at most one PrivatePinyin entry | | Regression for stale `AppleEnabledInputSources` / `AppleEnabledThirdPartyInputSources` records created by older default-enabled builds or manual `TISEnableInputSource` diagnostics |
| Enable input source | PrivatePinyin can be added and selected from the menu bar input menu | | |
| TextEdit composition | Typing `nihao` shows composition and candidate `你好`; typing `zhongguo` shows candidate `中国` | | |
| Commit | `Space` commits `你好` for `nihao` and `中国` for `zhongguo` | | |
| Candidate position | Candidate panel follows the insertion point in TextEdit | | |
| Horizontal candidate layout | A pinyin query with at least nine matches displays candidates `1` through `9` in one horizontal row; number keys select the matching visible entry | | macOS `0.1.17` uses the native 9-column stepping panel and migrates the previous default page size from 5 to 9 |
| Number-key selection | In TextEdit, Safari, Chrome, and VS Code, each key `1` through `9` selects exactly the matching visible candidate once | | `IMKCandidatesSendServerKeyEventFirst=true` makes the controller/core the first and only handling path for consumed digit keys |
| Shift behavior | Standalone Shift toggles mode; `Shift+A` inserts uppercase text | | |
| App switch cleanup | Start partial composition, switch apps, return, and type again; stale preedit/candidates do not reappear | | |
| Candidate panel lifecycle | Switch repeatedly among TextEdit, Safari, and Chrome with candidates visible/hidden at least 20 times; typing keeps working and no new `PrivatePinyin` crash report appears | | |
| AI Lite fallback | On a supported-memory machine, ordinary candidate selection still works when AI initialization is unavailable or deliberately rejected; no key, preedit, candidate, or commit is lost | | Record memory, initialization state, and sanitized error code only |
| AI candidate stability | Type rapidly, backspace, switch candidate pages, and continue composing while AI work is pending; an already visible numbered page never changes identity and stale results never commit | | Repeat in TextEdit, Safari, Chrome, and VS Code |
| Secure-input privacy | In native secure fields and Safari/Chrome webpage password fields, base typing/fallback remains available while secure-input detection prevents AI requests; leaving secure input starts a fresh composition with no stale result | | `IsSecureEventInputEnabled` is a best-effort global macOS signal, so record only whether AI was suppressed; never record entered content in evidence |
| AI Helper isolation | Run `PRIVATE_PINYIN_REQUIRE_SWIFTC=1 bash scripts/test_macos_ai_helper.sh`; authentication, health, cancellation, forced termination, restart, and shutdown pass, while TextEdit typing remains available with the helper missing or terminated | | Verify the helper inside the final signed/notarized app has a valid nested code signature |
| AI Helper idle exit | Leave an authenticated helper unused for ten minutes and confirm it exits; the next optional health request starts a fresh authenticated child | | Ordinary IMK typing must remain unaffected before, during, and after exit |
| Settings menu | Strict privacy toggle, clear, export, and open-settings actions run | | |
| Browser/editor pass | Repeat basic `nihao -> 你好` in Safari, Chrome, and VS Code | | |
| Stale process check | After the guided refresh or logout/login fallback, no pre-install PrivatePinyin PID remains before smoke testing | | |
| Uninstall | `platform/macos_imk/installer/uninstall-local.sh` removes the app | | |

## iOS Keyboard Smoke

Environment:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Tester | |
| Date | |
| iOS/iPadOS version | |
| Simulator/device | |
| Commit | |
| Build artifact | |

Checklist:

| Check | Expected result | Result | Evidence / notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Build | `scripts/build_ios_keyboard.sh` produces simulator app and keyboard extension | | |
| Automated readiness | `scripts/run_ios_smoke_readiness.sh` passes, including Info.plist, App Group, Full Access, default settings, and Keyboard Extension no-network source checks | | |
| Install | Container app installs on simulator/device | | |
| Enable keyboard | PrivatePinyin can be added from Settings > General > Keyboard | | |
| Full Access | Full Access remains off by default | | |
| Learning opt-in | Container app shows learning disabled by default; the toggle enables only when App Group storage is available | | |
| App Group storage | With Full Access off, verify whether the keyboard extension can read/write the shared App Group settings and SQLite path; if denied, typing still works through built-in defaults and learning remains disabled | | |
| Notes composition | Typing `nihao` shows candidate `你好`; tapping it commits `你好` | | |
| QWERTY preserved | The original full keyboard and symbols page remain available after the nine-key update | | |
| Station Cat layout | Candidate strip, QWERTY keys, nine-key grid, inline preferences, and pressed states use the warm-dark handoff tokens without clipping or overlap | | |
| Immediate response | Rapid full-key and nine-key taps update preedit/candidates once per tap without waiting for an exaggerated release delay | | |
| Candidate groups | Each group exposes up to nine candidates; swipe the candidate strip to reach long-text candidates, while fixed next/previous controls remain visible and change groups once without being pushed offscreen | | |
| Extended symbols | Open `123`, tap `#+=`, and verify `【】{}#%^*+=`, `_—\\|~《》$&·`, ellipsis, Chinese comma, `^^`, `?`, `!`, and apostrophe each insert once; tap `123` to return and confirm the basic symbol page is unchanged | | |
| Nine-key switch | Tap `九宫` to show the 1/2-9 layout, tap `全键` to return to QWERTY, then switch among at least two host apps and recreate the keyboard process; the selected Chinese layout persists even with Full Access off, and the freshest timestamped shared/local preference wins when both stores exist | | |
| Nine-key controls | The top row ends with `GHI`, Delete is the bottom-right key, and the top-left `，。？` key opens the selectable symbol page without inserting or losing composition unexpectedly | | |
| Nine-key composition | In the nine-key layout, typing `64426` shows `你好`; Space or tapping the candidate commits exactly once | | |
| Nine-key preedit | Type `9664`; the composition strip shows the leading candidate's readable pinyin such as `yong`, never the internal `9664` lookup signature when candidates exist | | |
| Nine-key continuous input | A longer 2-9 digit sequence can produce a segmented phrase candidate without switching back to QWERTY | | |
| Nine-key mode isolation | Switching to English shows QWERTY; switching back to Chinese restores the saved nine-key layout without stale composition | | |
| Return key | The bottom-right key is labeled `回车`; with no active composition it inserts a newline or lets the host field perform its normal Return action | | |
| Simplified/Traditional output | Open inline preferences, switch `输出字形` to `繁體`, and confirm `limian` displays and commits `裡面`; switch back to `简体` and confirm it displays and commits `里面` without rebuilding the keyboard engine | | |
| Traditional phrase quality | In `繁體`, verify `头发`, `发展`, `面条`, `皇后在后面`, `只有一只猫`, and `制作制度` display and commit as `頭髮`, `發展`, `麵條`, `皇后在後面`, `只有一隻貓`, and `製作制度`; treat the feature as generic system Traditional rather than full Taiwan/Hong Kong localization | | |
| Script persistence | Reopen the keyboard after selecting `繁體`; candidates, committed text, and predictions remain Traditional while pinyin preedit and the shared local-learning ranking remain unchanged | | |
| Mixed shorthand | In QWERTY mode, type `zyao`; `主要` is the first candidate and can be committed exactly once; ordinary `woshi`, `jintian`, and `zhongguo` still rank `我是`, `今天`, and `中国` first | | |
| Prediction retention | `jintian -> 今天` keeps prediction candidates such as `天气` after commit | | |
| Self-change callback | Commit several candidates quickly and switch host fields within 250 ms; delayed `textDidChange` callbacks caused by the keyboard's own insert/delete operations do not clear the new candidate or prediction state, while document-identity/context changes from a real external field still reset composition | | |
| Globe key | Globe appears only when `needsInputModeSwitchKey` requires it and switches to the next input mode | | |
| Nine-key compact height | In landscape, the five-column nine-key grid fits without constraint warnings, clipping, or overlapping controls; Globe/layout, `中/英`, `候选`, Delete, and Return remain reachable | | |
| Nine-key mode control | Tap `中/英` in nine-key mode; English QWERTY appears, and switching back to Chinese restores the saved nine-key layout and active controls | | |
| Haptic fallback | With Full Access off, every key remains responsive whether iOS emits or suppresses the optional haptic feedback | | |
| Password fallback | Password fields force the system keyboard | | |
| Phone fallback | Phone-number fields force the system keyboard | | |
| No network | With Full Access off, there is no network API usage or network prompt | | |

## Blocking Rules

- A failed automated gate blocks merge.
- A failed manual smoke test does not block Stage 08 documentation/CI work unless it is caused by code changed in the same branch.
- Failed manual smoke checks must produce or update an `OPEN_ITEMS` entry before release-readiness work continues.
